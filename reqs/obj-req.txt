-------------------------------------------------
We will use the following features:

- The price of the stock at the beginning of the day
- The price of the stock at the end of the day
- The highest price of the stock during the day
- The lowest price of the stock during the day
- The average price of the stock during the day
- The volume of the stock traded during the day

The goal is to predict whether the price of the stock will go up or down at the end of the day.

To do this, we will use a logistic regression model.

First, we need to prepare the data.

We will use the pandas library to read in the data from the Binance API.

We will also use the numpy library to perform some mathematical operations.

We will use the sklearn library to build the logistic regression model.

We will use the matplotlib library to visualize the data.

We will use the seaborn library to visualize the data.

We will use the pickle library to save the model.

We will use the os library to create the directories for the data and the model.

We will use the shutil library to copy the data

-------------------------------------------------

1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Load the data from the .csv file
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Train the logistic model on the training set
5. Test the logistic model on the testing set
6. Predict the price of the stock using the logistic model
